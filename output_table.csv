allerleirauh;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/allerleirauh;"A king promised his dying wife that he would not re-marry unless it was to a woman who was as beautiful as she was, and when he looked for a new wife, he realized that the only woman that could match her beauty was his own daughter.The daughter tried to make the wedding impossible by asking for three dresses, one as golden as the sun, one as silver as the moon, and one as dazzling as the stars, and a mantle made from the fur of every kind of bird and animal in the kingdom. When her father provided them, she took them, with a gold ring, a gold spindle, and a gold reel, and ran from the castle the night before the wedding.She ran far away to another kingdom, and slept in a great forest there, but the young king of that place and his dogs found her while he was hunting. She asked the king to have pity on her and received a place in the kitchen, where she worked, and because she gave no name she was called ""All-Kinds-of-Fur.""When the king held a ball, she snuck out and went to it in her golden dress. The next morning, the cook set her to make soup for the king, and she put her golden ring in it. The king found it and questioned the cook and then All-Kinds-of-Fur, but she revealed nothing. The next ball, she went dressed in her silver dress and put the golden spindle in the soup, and the king again could discover nothing.The third ball, she went in the star dress, and the king slipped a golden ring on her finger without her noticing it and ordered that the last dance go longer than usual. She was not able to get away in time to change; she was able only to throw her fur mantle over her clothing before she had to cook the soup. When the king questioned her, he caught her hand, seeing the ring, and when she tried to pull it away, her mantle slipped, revealing the dress of stars. The king pulled off the mantle, revealing her, and they married.

Heartbroken and alone, Allerleirauh wandered into the depths of a vast forest. As she stumbled through the undergrowth, she came across a magnificent stag. With gentle eyes, the stag led her to a secluded clearing where she discovered a tiny cottage.  Inside the cottage lived an elderly woman who took pity on Allerleirauh. She offered her shelter and a new identity. Allerleirauh disguised herself as a servant girl named Aschenputtel, covering her golden hair and delicate features in grime.  Meanwhile, in a distant realm, rumors of Allerleirauh's beauty had reached the ears of a young king. Determined to find her, he traveled far and wide. One evening, he came across a grand ball at the King's castle.  As Allerleirauh watched from the sidelines, the young king's gaze fell upon her. Despite her humble attire, he recognized the princess beneath the layers of dirt. Intrigued, he invited her to dance.  As they twirled across the ballroom floor, Allerleirauh's secret was revealed when a hazelnut fell from her pocket. Her father recognized the nut as a token he had given her years ago.  Enraged, the King ordered Aschenputtel to be seized. However, the young king intervened, promising to marry the mysterious servant girl.

The Devil then offers to make the soldier rich if for seven years, he will neither cut his hair, clip his nails, bathe, nor cite the Lord's Prayer, and wear a coat and cloak. If the soldier survives, he will be rich and free but if he dies, the Devil will claim his soul. The desperate soldier agrees, and the Devil makes him wear both the green coat - telling him he will find its pockets always full of money - and the dead bear's skin, telling him that he must sleep in it and will be known as Bearskin because of it.Bearskin sets out, donating money to the poor and asking them to pray for him to live out the seven years. After three years, Bearskin becomes so revolting that he must pay heavily to get any shelter. In the fourth year, he hears an old man lamenting and persuades him to tell his tale: the old man has lost all his money and does not know how to provide for his three daughters nor pay the innkeeper, so he will be jailed. Bearskin pays the innkeeper and gives the old man a purse of gold as well. The old man thanks Bearskin by allowing him to marry any of his three daughters. The oldest daughter runs away in fear. The middle one says that Bearskin is worse than an actual bear passing off as human. The youngest daughter agrees to fulfill her father's promise. Bearskin gives his fiancée one half of a ring and promises to return in three years. The maiden then dresses in black, waiting for her betrothed as her sisters mock her endlessly.At the end of the seven years, Bearskin finds the Devil again and demands that he fulfill his promise. The Devil then proceeds to bathe Bearskin, clip his nails, cut his hair, and say the Lord's Prayer. The Devil warns Bearskin not to push his luck, as he has already won their bargain, and disappears.

Night after night, the spirit guided Ethan, leading him through secret passages and revealing the witch's weakness. Finally, the time came for Ethan to make his daring escape.

A foul stench hung in the air. It was the den of robbers.  Undeterred, the soldier and huntsman drew their weapons and charged into the house. They encountered a gruesome sightâ€”the robbers, their faces obscured by dark hoods, were torturing a helpless old woman.  Enraged, the soldier leapt to her defense. He fought valiantly, his sword gleaming through the shadows. The huntsman, armed with his bow and arrow, provided cover, picking off the robbers one by one.  In the midst of the chaos, the soldier's boots, crafted from the finest buffalo leather, proved invaluable. They protected his feet from the broken glass and sharp objects scattered about the hideout.  As the battle raged, one of the robbers realized the soldier's weaknessâ€”his exposed head. With a cunning move, he hurled a heavy object at the soldier.  But just as the object was about to strike, the huntsman's arrow pierced the robber's hand, sending the projectile harmlessly to the ground. The soldier, grateful for his ally's intervention, pressed on with renewed vigor.  One by one, the robbers fell, until only one remained. Desperate, he tried to escape through a hidden back door. But the soldier, his boots giving him exceptional speed, chased after him.  With a swift thrust of his sword, the soldier felled the last robber. The old woman, freed from her captors, wept tears of joy.  In recognition of their bravery, the townspeople showered the soldier and huntsman with praise. And so, the soldier known as the one with the Boots of Buffalo Leather became a legend, a symbol of justice and heroism in the land.;issues led the model to mostly summarise the correct story, instead of a creative retelling, but the final twist is missing
the brave little tailor ;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_brave_little_tailor;"A tailor is preparing to eat some jam, but when flies settle on it, he kills seven of them with one blow of his hand. He makes a belt describing the deed, reading ""Seven at One Blow"". Inspired, he sets out into the world to seek his fortune. The tailor meets a giant who assumes that ""Seven at One Blow"" refers to seven men. The giant challenges the tailor. When the giant squeezes water from a boulder, the tailor squeezes milk, or whey, from cheese. The giant throws a rock far into the air, and it eventually lands. The tailor counters the feat by tossing a bird that flies away into the sky; the giant believes the small bird is a ""rock"" which is thrown so far that it never lands. Later, the giant asks the tailor to help him carry a tree. The tailor directs the giant to carry the trunk, while the tailor will carry the branches. Instead, the tailor climbs on, so the giant carries him as well, but it appears as if the tailor is supporting the branches.Impressed, the giant brings the tailor to the giant's home, where other giants live as well. During the night, the giant attempts to kill the tailor by bashing the bed. However, the tailor, having found the bed too large, had slept in the corner. Upon returning and seeing the tailor alive, the other giants flee in fear of the small man.The tailor enters the royal service, but the other soldiers are afraid that he will lose his temper someday, and then seven of them might die with every blow. They tell the king that either the tailor leaves military service or they will. Afraid of being killed for sending him away, the king instead attempts to get rid of the tailor by sending him to defeat two giants along with a hundred horsemen, offering him half his kingdom and his daughter's hand in marriage if the tailor can kill the giants. By throwing rocks at the two giants while they sleep, the tailor provokes the pair into fighting each other until they kill each other, at which time the tailor stabs the giants in their hearts.The king, surprised the tailor has succeeded, balks on his promise, and requires more of the tailor before he may claim his rewards. The king next sends him after a unicorn, another seemingly impossible task, but the tailor traps it by standing before a tree, so that when the unicorn charges, he steps aside and it drives its horn into the trunk. The king subsequently sends him after a wild boar, but the tailor traps it in a chapel with a similar luring technique.Duly impressed, the king relents, marries the tailor to the princess, and makes the tailor the ruler of half the original kingdom.
